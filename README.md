## üìã Requirements

- Windows 10 or later
- PowerShell (for some download methods)
- Administrator privileges for uninstallation

## üîß Usage

Download the scripts and run them from Command Prompt or PowerShell. Make sure to run as a regular user unless specified.

### 1. Install Git via Winget
```cmd
install_git_winget.cmd
```
- Checks if Winget is available.
- Installs Git silently for the current user.
- Configures global Git settings (e.g., default branch to main, CRLF handling).

### 2. Install Git via Direct Download
```cmd
install_git.cmd
```
- Downloads the latest Git installer (v2.50.1 ‚Äì update the script for newer versions).
- Installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Git` with predefined options (Vim as editor, OpenSSH, etc.).
- Handles downloads via curl, PowerShell, or bitsadmin.

### 3. Update Git
```cmd
update_git.cmd
```
- Uses Git's built-in updater to fetch and install the latest version.
- Run as a regular user.

### 4. Uninstall Git
```cmd
uninstall_git.cmd
```
- **Requires Administrator privileges** (right-click and run as admin).
- Searches common paths like `%ProgramFiles%\Git`, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Git`.
- Runs the uninstaller silently and cleans up remaining files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Tools

The `Tools` folder contains helpful utilities for managing Git repositories and configurations:

### Repository Management Tools

#### Bulk Operations for Multiple Repositories
```cmd
Tools\git_pull_all.cmd
```
- Automatically finds all Git repositories in the current directory.
- Runs `git pull` on each repository to fetch the latest changes.
- Perfect for keeping multiple projects up-to-date at once.

```cmd
Tools\git_push_all.cmd
```
- Finds all Git repositories in the current directory.
- Prompts for a commit message.
- Stages all changes (`git add .`), commits with your message, and pushes to remote.
- Great for quickly committing and pushing changes across multiple projects.

```cmd
Tools\git_gc_all.cmd
```
- Runs garbage collection (`git gc`) on all repositories in the current directory.
- Optimizes repository size and performance by cleaning up unnecessary files.
- Useful for maintaining repository health across multiple projects.

### Configuration Tools

#### User Details Setup
```cmd
Tools\git_set_details.cmd
```
- Prompts for your Git username and email address.
- Sets global Git configuration (`git config --global user.name` and `user.email`).
- Essential for ensuring your commits are properly attributed.

#### Line Ending Configuration
```cmd
Tools\set_git_crlf.cmd
```
- Sets Git to use CRLF (Windows-style) line endings.
- Configures `core.autocrlf=true` and `core.eol=crlf`.
- Recommended for Windows-only development environments.

```cmd
Tools\set_git_lf.cmd
```
- Sets Git to use LF (Unix/Linux-style) line endings.
- Configures `core.autocrlf=false` and `core.eol=lf`.
- Recommended for cross-platform development or when working with Unix/Linux systems.

### Usage Tips
- Run the bulk operation tools from a parent directory containing multiple Git repositories.
- All tools include built-in Git installation checks and error handling.
- Tools automatically skip non-Git directories when scanning for repositories.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

During installation, the scripts set these global Git configs for a smooth Windows experience:
- Default branch: `main`
- Line endings: CRLF
- Editor: Vim
- Credential helper: manager
- Performance: FSCache and preloadindex enabled
- And more! Check the scripts for full details.
